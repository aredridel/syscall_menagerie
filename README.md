Syscall Menagerie
=================

This is a menagerie of Linux system calls. We already have great references (use `man 2 open` for that!). This isn't a reference. It's not a textbook, or an authoritative source. It's a menagerie!

Instead, you'll find *stories* about system calls. You'll find out how they're used in practice, and ways that people have used them to debug. Maybe we'll even end up with historical anecdotes!

Here's what we have so far: 

* [`open`](https://github.com/jvns/syscall_menagerie/blob/master/open.md) [(pretty PDF)](https://gitprint.com/jvns/syscall_menagerie/blob/master/open.md)
* [`write`](https://github.com/jvns/syscall_menagerie/blob/master/write.md) [(pretty PDF)](https://gitprint.com/jvns/syscall_menagerie/blob/master/write.md)

## Contributing

Do you think this sounds like fun? Do you have stories about your favorite system calls? I'd love it if you contributed. Just send in a pull request adding a new file to this repository! Use `open.md` and `write.md` as a template, or add your own touch!
